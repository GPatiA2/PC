# Programación Concurrente

This repository contains the assignments for the subject "Programación Concurrente" which I took during my third year studying at UCM.

The most relevant content of this repo is located in the folder "Proyecto final". It contains a p2p text file distribution system alongside a local network that can handle multiple concurrent transferences. The goal of the project was to learn how to use Semaphores, Locks, Monitors and Distributed Programming primitives. 

The project is divided between a Client project and a Server project which you should execute apart from each other to check the functionality
